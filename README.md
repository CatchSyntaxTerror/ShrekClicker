# 🧅 Shrek Clicker

Welcome to **Shrek Clicker** — the game where you try and click on Shrek.  
(Yes, really.)

---

## 🎮 What’s This?

A simple, delightful canvas-based game that throws Shrek at you in random spots across his swampy kingdom.  
Click Shrek to make him move around.

## 🕹️ How to Play?

- 🖱️ Open `index.html` in a browser.  
- 👆 Click on Shrek’s green mug wherever he pops up.  
- 🏃‍♂️ Watch him leap to a new spot — like he’s avoiding spoilers for *Shrek 5*.

## 🧩 What’s Inside?

- 🧾 **HTML**: Sets the stage with a canvas ready for ogre action.  
- 🎨 **CSS**: Makes the swamp look cozy with a blanchedalmond canvas and a pitch-black background because ogres love their privacy.  
- 🧙‍♂️ **JavaScript**: Handles the magic — loading images, tracking clicks, and teleporting Shrek faster than you can say *Donkey!*.

## 🤷‍♂️ Why?

Because sometimes the best therapy is clicking on an animated ogre and watching him run away.

## 🐛 Known Bugs

The only bug is that some of the images are quite large, so you don’t always have to click *right* on Shrek...  
…but my flight was about to take off, so we call that “agile development.” ✈️
