# Shrek Clicker


Welcome to **Shrek Clicker** — the game where you try and click on shrek.



## What’s this?

A simple, delightful canvas-based game that throws Shrek at you in random spots across his swampy kingdom. Click Shrek to make him move around.


## How to play?

- Open `index.html` in a browser.  
- Click on Shrek’s green mug wherever he pops up.  
- Watch him leap to a new spot—like he’s avoiding spoilers for *Shrek 5*.


## What’s inside?

- **HTML:** Sets the stage with a canvas ready for ogre action.  
- **CSS:** Makes the swamp look cozy with a blanchedalmond canvas and a pitch-black background because ogres love their privacy.  
- **JavaScript:** Handles the magic — loading images, tracking clicks, and teleporting Shrek faster than you can say *Donkey!*.


## Why?

Because sometimes the best therapy is clicking on an animated ogre and watching him run away.

## known bugs

The only bug is that some of the images are quite large so you dont always have to click right on shrek, but my flight is about to take off.
