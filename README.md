# Shrek Clicker


Welcome to **Shrek Clicker** — the game where you try and cclick on shrek.



## What’s this?

A simple, delightful canvas-based game that throws Shrek at you in random spots across his swampy kingdom. Click Shrek to make him move around.


## How to play?

- Open `index.html` in a browser.  
- Click on Shrek’s green mug wherever he pops up.  
- Watch him leap to a new spot—like he’s avoiding spoilers for *Shrek 5*.


## What’s inside?

- **HTML:** Sets the stage with a canvas ready for ogre action.  
- **CSS:** Makes the swamp look cozy with a blanchedalmond canvas and a pitch-black background because ogres love their privacy.  
- **JavaScript:** Handles the magic — loading images, tracking clicks, and teleporting Shrek faster than you can say *Donkey!*.


## Why?

Because sometimes the best therapy is clicking on an animated ogre and watching him run away.
